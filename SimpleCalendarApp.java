/*
 * Simple Calendar Application
 * ===========================
 * This application should support:
 * 1) Listing all events for the day
 * 2) List all remaining events for the day
 * 3) List all events for any specified day
 * 4) Provide the next available slot of a specified size for today OR the specified day.
 * 
 * Current Issues:
 * ==============
 * 1) What if a user wants to make event that spans multiple days?
 *  -> Change LocalTime to LocalDateTime in Event.java?
 *  -> Split multi day events into different events at midnight in AppointmentManager.java?

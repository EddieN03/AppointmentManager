# AppointmentManager
# Option 2: Simple Calendar Application
Create an application for a simple Calendar and appointment management. The user
should be able to create an event by specifying its title, start time, and end time. The
application should prevent overlapping events.
The applications should support:
• Listing all events for the day
• List all remaining events for the day
• List all events for any specified day
• Provide the next available slot of a specified size for today or the specified day.
All data can be kept in memory or in a file. A database is not necessary.
Use any programming language to build the application. The application can be
command-line-based; a UI is not necessary, but it can be included if preferred.
Submit your response by putting it in a public GitHub repo. The repo should include
1. Short presentation explaining
• Your approach and design
• Key files and folders
• Process to run, test, and verify
• Include test data and seed data as required
2. Code for the application
Additionally, a hosted version of the app can also be submitted if preferred.
